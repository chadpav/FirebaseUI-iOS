# FirebaseUI for iOS â€” UI Bindings for Firebase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS)

FirebaseUI is an open-source library for iOS that allows you to quickly connect common UI elements to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com?utm_source=FirebaseUI-iOS) database for data storage, allowing views to be updated in realtime as they change, and providing simple interfaces for common tasks like displaying lists or collections of items.

Additionally, FirebaseUI simplifies Firebase authentication by providing easy to use auth methods that integrate with common identity providers like Facebook, Twitter, and Google as well as allowing developers to use a built in headful UI for ease of development.

FirebaseUI clients are also available for [Android](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android) and [web](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web).

## Installing FirebaseUI for iOS

FirebaseUI supports iOS 8.0+. We recommend using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=firebaseui-ios), add
the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'FirebaseUI', '~> 0.5'       # Pull in all Firebase UI features
```

If you don't want to use all of FirebaseUI, there are multiple subspecs which can selectively install subsets of the full feature set:

```ruby
# Only pull in the "Database" FirebaseUI features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Database', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Auth" FirebaseUI features (including Facebook and Google)
pod 'FirebaseUI/Auth', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Facebook" login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Facebook', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Google" login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Google', '~> 0.4'

```

If you're including FirebaseUI in a Swift project, make sure you also have:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
```

Otherwise, you can download the latest version of the [FirebaseUI.framework from the releases
page](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/releases) or include the FirebaseUI
Xcode project from this repo in your project. You also need to [add the Firebase
framework](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_auth_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads) to your project.
