# FirebaseUI for iOS â€” UI Bindings for Firebase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS)

FirebaseUI is an open-source library for iOS that allows you to quickly connect common UI elements to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_auth_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads) database for data storage, allowing views to be updated in realtime as they change, and providing simple interfaces for common tasks like displaying lists or collections of items.

Additionally, FirebaseUI simplifies Firebase authentication by providing easy to use auth methods that integrate with common identity providers like Facebook, Twitter, and Google as well as allowing developers to use a built in headful UI for ease of development.

A compatible FirebaseUI client is also available for [Android](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android).

## Installing FirebaseUI for iOS

FirebaseUI supports iOS 7.0+. We recommend using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=firebaseui-ios), add
the following to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'FirebaseUI', '~> 0.4'       # Pull in all Firebase UI features
```

If you don't want to use all of FirebaseUI, there are multiple subspecs which can selectively install subsets of the full feature set:

```
# Only pull in the "Database" FirebaseUI features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Database', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Auth" FirebaseUI features (including Facebook and Google)
pod 'FirebaseUI/Auth', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Facebook" login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Facebook', '~> 0.4'

# Only pull in the "Google" login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Google', '~> 0.4'

```

If you're including FirebaseUI in a Swift project, make sure you also have:

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
```

Otherwise, you can download the latest version of the [FirebaseUI.framework from the releases
page](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/releases) or include the FirebaseUI
Xcode project from this repo in your project. You also need to [add the Firebase
framework](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_update_awareness_auth_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_featureoverview_awareness_analytics_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads&utm_medium=?utm_campaign=Firebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=ads) to your project.

## Local Setup

If you'd like to contribute to FirebaseUI for iOS, you'll need to run the
following commands to get your environment set up:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.git
$ cd FirebaseUI-iOS
$ pod install
```

FirebaseUI makes use of Xcode 7 features such as lightweight generics and
`__kindof` annotations, and is no longer compatible with Xcode 6 development.

## Deployment

- `git pull` to update the master branch
- tag and push the tag for this release
- `./build_database.sh` to build a database binary (Auth binary steps will be added soon)
- `./create-docs.sh` to generate docs
- From your macbook that already has been granted permissions to FirebaseUI CocoaPods, do `pod trunk push`
- `firebase deploy` the FirebaseUI website with newly generated docs
